## Model Code and Data Repository

**Author Names:** Kimberly E. Samuels-Crow, Kiona Ogle, Marcy E. Litvak

This repository contains model code and data files used for the analysis presented in "Atmosphere-Soil Interactions Govern Ecosystem Flux Sensitivity to Environmental Conditions in Semiarid Woody Ecosystems over Varying Timescales" (JGR-Biogeosciences, 2020).

**ModelCode:** 
Contains script for initializing and running the Stochastic Antecedent (SAM) model and the model code for the SAM model.

**DataFiles:**
Data files with fluxes and covariate data (daily timestep) from the sites included in this study. The raw 30-minute data files are available for download from the Ameriflux website (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/download-data/).
